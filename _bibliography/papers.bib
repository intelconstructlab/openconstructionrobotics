  title     = {ICON-Pose: Toward Egocentric Action Recognition for Intelligent Construction},
  abstract  = { The working environment of construction workers is often hazardous and dynamic, leading not only to decline in worker productivity but also fatal accidents. Monitoring of workers’ behavior has thus gained increasing attention in the construction community for hazard monitoring, ergonomic analysis, and productivity estimation. Egocentric action recognition is robust and promising in identifying, localizing, and tracking workers’ actions. However, the insufficiency of publicly available datasets designated for egocentric construction workers’ action recognition hampers the training and evaluation of existing and newly developed deep-learning models. In this regard, this paper introduces ICON-Pose, the first open dataset built specifically for estimating construction workers’ poses via egocentric view. ICON-Pose offers hundreds of egocentric images and corresponding 2D workers’ body joints in 38 actions, categorized in 10 basic construction tasks, including “connect,” “cover,” “cut,” “dig,” “finish,” “place,” “position,” “spray,” “spread,” and “others.” ICON-Pose with the proposed pose estimation model demonstrates the ability in accurately depicting diverse construction workers’ poses as well as the robustness in describing unique construction poses. The proposed dataset is expected to invigorate and support artificial intelligence research in construction workers’ behavior tracking and has the potential of serving as a benchmark dataset for subsequent analysis. },

  abstract = {The inefficiency, labor-intensity, and possibility of automation of the current practice of HVAC system inspections, which heavily relies on human inspectors, are being questioned. This paper describes a lightweight and reproducible robotic system dubbed AcTEA-bot, that automatically detects and locates thermal leaks in ceiling environments while self-navigating. AcTEA-bot is designed and built upon three modules, including an active visual SLAM module, a thermal leak detection module, and a thermal leak registration module. To evaluate the effectiveness of AcTEA-bot, a true-to-scale ceiling environment containing five thermal leaks is built, and 30 experiments are conducted where AcTEA-bot starts with different poses and conducts the inspection task. Results demonstrate that thermal leaks of multiple types in ceiling environments can be accurately detected and located.},

  abstract = {We propose TEA-bot (Thermography Enabled Autonomous Robot) to address the problem of labor-intensive manual inspections of thermal leaks in Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems while avoiding installation of sensor networks, which can be challenging and expensive for existing buildings. TEA-bot is an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) designed to navigate in ceilings using visual-based Simultaneously Localization And Mapping (SLAM) while detecting thermal leaks from HVAC systems using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). TEA-bot uses inexpensive 3D printed parts as the bones, a single-board computer (SBC) as the brain, an RGB-D camera as the eyes, and a thermal camera as the leak detector. We build an in-lab ceiling environment as a true-to-size testing site with five types of common leaks in HVAC systems (e.g., improper connection) to test the feasibility and effectiveness of TEA-bot. Results show that TEA-bot can 1) generate high-resolution ceiling maps in the format of point clouds for existing buildings without Building Information Models (BIMs), with an average error of 1.56 inches in duct length measurements; 2) identify leak types with a precision of 86.60\% using the thermal camera images; and 3) register leaks onto the point cloud maps, providing a holistic and intuitive view of leak locations in an unknown ceiling environment.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
